# Real-Time International Space Station (ISS) Tracker

![Screen Shot 2024-07-29 at 2 35 38 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae27ef1d-cbd5-4cf2-b3df-8a474f716109)

This project demonstrates how to track the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time using Python. By leveraging two different APIs, we retrieve data on the ISS's location and the astronauts currently on board. This information is visually represented on a world map, providing a captivating view of the ISS's journey around the Earth.

## Project Overview

The ISS represents one of humanity's most significant achievements in space exploration, with international collaboration at its core. By building this real-time ISS tracker, you'll gain a greater appreciation for the remarkable work done aboard the ISS and learn essential skills in API integration and graphical data representation using Python.

## Features

1. **Astronaut Information**: Display the names and number of astronauts currently aboard the ISS.
2. **Location Tracking**: Retrieve and display the ISS's real-time latitude and longitude.
3. **Graphical Representation**: Visualize the ISS's position on a world map using the Turtle graphics library in Python.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Astronaut Data**: Fetch and display the names and number of astronauts aboard the ISS.
2. **World Map and ISS Image**: Set up a graphical representation with a world map and an ISS icon.
3. **Real-Time ISS Tracking**: Continuously update the ISS's position on the map based on real-time data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Internet connection for API access
- Libraries: `json`, `turtle`, `urllib`, `time`, `geocoder`

## Getting Started

To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. You can follow along with the accompanying [video tutorial](#) for detailed guidance. Additionally, refer to the [NASA website](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the [Open Notify API documentation](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) for further information.

## Running Script

``` python3 main.py ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a GUI for a more interactive experience.
- Add notifications when the ISS passes over specific locations.
- Display additional data such as the speed and altitude of the ISS.
